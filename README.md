# Human_Body_Temperature
An exercise in hypothesis testing using both graphical and bootstrapping methods. Focused on the temperature of the human body.

To summarize the results of this exercise I've concluded that: 
- Through graphical inspection of the CDF the data collected follows a normal distribution.
- The null hypothesis that the true mean of the population is 98.6 is rejected after one sample bootstrap testing
- Without the population standard deviation the t-test was used in favor of the z-test and yieled a very small t-statistic, thus rejecting the null hypothesis.
- The 95% confidence interval was very tight around 98Â°F.
- The body temperatures of men and women had distinct distributions, with varying means. Although both were normal. 

This was an interesting exercise and provided a great proving ground for basic applications of bootstrapping.
